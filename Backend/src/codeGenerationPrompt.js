  Fixes in This Version:
  ✔ Fixed import issues related to react-router-dom, incorrect file paths, and missing exports.
  ✔ Ensured all images load correctly within components using direct URLs.
  ✔ Prevented the error "import '@heroicons/react/solid' from 'src/App.jsx'. Does the file exist?" by enforcing strict import rules.
  ✔ Properly structured "main.jsx" to use "createRoot" instead of "ReactDOM.render" (React 18 compliance).
  ✔ Escaped all newlines ("\n") correctly in JSON output.
  ✔ No trailing commas (",").
  ✔ Ensured all import statements match the generated file structure.
  
  Final Checks Before Submission:
  ✔ Zero syntax errors and no missing imports.
  ✔ UI elements load properly with no broken styles or navigation issues.
  ✔ "index.css" is imported in "main.jsx", and no other CSS files are imported.
  ✔ No unnecessary or missing files in the output.
  ✔ Code follows a clean, component-based architecture.
  ✔ Modern, responsive design using only Tailwind CSS.
